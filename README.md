# Predicting-Employee-Attrition
In this project, our primary objective is to develop a predictive model for employee attrition. We aim to distinguish between companies where employees choose to leave (1) and those where they opt to stay (0).

Employee attrition prediction holds significant importance for businesses as it enables proactive measures to retain valuable talent and reduce turnover costs. By gaining insights into the factors influencing attrition, we can provide actionable recommendations to improve employee satisfaction and retention strategies.
